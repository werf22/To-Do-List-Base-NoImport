# AI To Do List App - Development Tasks

## Explanation:

*   **Structure:** Organizes tasks logically by the development phases defined in PLANNING.md.
*   **Checkboxes:** Uses Markdown checkboxes ([ ], [x]) to clearly track completed versus pending tasks.
*   **Granularity:** Tasks are broken down into manageable steps within each phase (e.g., backend logic, frontend component creation, API endpoint implementation).
*   **Clarity:** Describes what needs to be done for each task.
*   **Current Focus:** Clearly highlights the next immediate phase and tasks.
*   **Backlog:** Provides a place to capture future ideas without cluttering the main plan.

## Overall Goal

Create a custom AI-powered Task Management web application based on the specifications in `PRD.txt` and the data model defined in `config/TASK_FIELD_CONFIG.ts` and `prisma/schema.prisma`.

## Current Status

*   **Phase 0: Foundation** is in progress.
*   **Database Setup Complete:** PostgreSQL database created and configured with Prisma.
*   **Initial Migration Complete:** Database schema initialized from prisma/schema.prisma.
*   **Testing Setup:** Jest configured for unit testing.
*   **Next Steps:** Implement Next.js application structure, API routes, and basic UI components.

## Task Breakdown by Phase

**Phase 0: Foundation (Core MVP)**

*   [x] Finalize `PRD.txt` requirements document.
*   [x] Define core data structure in `config/TASK_FIELD_CONFIG.ts`.
*   [x] Define database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
*   [x] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
*   [x] Install Prisma and configure database connection (`DATABASE_URL` in `.env`).
*   [x] Create database utility `lib/prisma.ts`.
*   [x] Set up PostgreSQL database with proper user and privileges.
*   [x] Run initial Prisma migration (`npx prisma migrate dev`).
*   [ ] Create basic API route `app/api/tasks/route.ts` with:
    *   [ ] `GET` handler to fetch all tasks.
    *   [ ] `POST` handler to create a new task (accepting minimal fields: name, goal, context, optional: portfolio, priority, due_date).
*   [ ] Create main frontend page `app/page.tsx`.
*   [ ] Create frontend component `components/TaskForm.tsx` for adding tasks.
*   [ ] Create frontend component `components/TaskList.tsx` for displaying tasks.
*   [ ] Move all files to correct structure as per documentation.

**Phase 1: Core Task Management**

*   [ ] API: Implement single task endpoints in `app/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts`:
    *   [ ] `GET` handler to fetch a specific task by ID.
    *   [ ] `PATCH` handler to update a specific task.
    *   [ ] `DELETE` handler to remove a task.
*   [x] Frontend: Create detailed task view page `app/tasks/[id]/page.tsx`.
*   [x] Frontend: Implement editing functionality for all task fields.
*   [x] Frontend: Create custom Select and MultiSelect components for dropdown fields.
*   [x] Frontend: Enhance task detail view with proper input components for all field types.
*   [x] Frontend: Enhance TaskList with clear status indicators and formatting.
*   [x] Frontend: Add clickable links from task list to detailed view.
*   [x] Frontend: Add filtering capabilities for tasks (portfolio, project, status, priority).
*   [x] Data Management: Implement CSV import/export functionality.
*   [x] UI: Make the interface fully responsive.
*   [x] UX: Add loading states and error handling.
*   [x] Frontend: Implement task deletion for individual and batch operations.
*   [x] Backend: Create dedicated task deletion endpoints and emergency deletion features.
*   [ ] UX: Add toast notifications for actions.
*   [ ] Testing: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.

**Phase 2: AI Auto-Enrichment & Advanced Features**

*   [ ] Backend: Implement AI enrichment service and integrate with task creation.
*   [ ] API: Add AI trigger to POST /api/tasks.
*   [ ] Backend: Create AI workflow processing system.
*   [ ] Frontend: Create AI settings and controls panel.
*   [ ] Frontend: Add batch operations (delete, status update for multiple tasks).
*   [ ] Frontend: Implement sorting functionality for task lists.
*   [ ] UX: Add toast notifications for actions.
*   [ ] Testing: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**

*   [ ] Frontend: Create dashboard with task statistics.
*   [ ] Frontend: Add customizable views/layouts.
*   [ ] Backend: Implement full text search across tasks.
*   [ ] API: Create endpoints for batch operations.
*   [ ] Frontend: Add keyboard shortcuts for power users.
*   [ ] Backend: Implement more sophisticated background processing.
*   [ ] UX: Implement drag-and-drop for task organization.
*   [ ] System: Add performance optimizations.

## Migration Log

* 2025-04-22: Database setup completed with PostgreSQL user `aitodolist_user` and database `aitodolist_db`. Initial schema migration successful.
* 2025-04-22: Created custom Select and MultiSelect components to enhance the task detail page UI, enabling proper dropdown and multi-select functionality for fields like Portfolio, Project, Section, Tags, and more.
* 2025-04-22: Implemented reliable task deletion functionality with multiple approaches:
  * Added individual task delete buttons within the task list
  * Enhanced batch delete operations in the task list
  * Created a specialized emergency deletion page (/nuke-tasks) for handling edge cases
  * Added force-delete endpoint that uses raw SQL when needed for maximum reliability

## Backlog / Future Ideas

*   User Authentication / Authorization.
*   More sophisticated AI interactions (e.g., AI proposing field updates for user approval).
*   Dashboard view with summaries/stats.
*   Customizable views/layouts.
*   Notifications system (e.g., for tasks requiring user action).
*   Integration with Calendar APIs.
*   AI fine-tuning based on user feedback (`AI Output Rating`, `Feedback for AI`).
*   More robust background job system for AI tasks (e.g., BullMQ, Redis).
*   Full text search across tasks.
*   Mobile app version.
*   Integration with third-party productivity tools.
*   Time tracking for tasks.
